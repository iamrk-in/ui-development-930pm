            <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

            <!-- <p>Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can be a two-way street.</p> -->
            
            <p style="color: red;">Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>
            
            <p>In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.</p>

            <h3>Website content template components</h3>
        
            <p style="color: red; background-color: grey;">Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted. What’s their pain? What’s in it for them? Where are they in their buying process? And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your solution? The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.</p>

            <h3>Businesses and organizations</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>AirTran Airways (IATA airline code), defunct American airline</li>
                <li>FL Group, an Icelandic investment company with an emphasis on flight and tourism industry</li>
                <li>Foot Locker (ticker symbol), retailer</li>
            </ul>
                
            
            <h3>Numismatics</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Florin (disambiguation), various coins</li>
                <li>Guilder, various coins also sometimes called "florin"</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Typical web page structure and formatting guidelines</h3>
        
            <p>After years of experimenting, most of us web folks have the best practices of website content nailed down, and we feel like this template covers the bases. Here are a few key elements:</p>
            
            <h4>Headlines</h4>
        
            <p>As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a headline and programming the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice Google juice.</p>
            
            <h4>Sub-headlines:</h4>
        
            <p>Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused sub-headlines can really boost the odds that your page will be read. I like to run a “scan test” on every page  to see if I can get the gist of page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action.</p>
