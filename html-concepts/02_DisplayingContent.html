        <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

        <p>Over the years of <strong><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">developing websites</a></strong> for clients, I’ve learned that the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can be a two-way street.</p>
        
        <a href="#"><img src="images/getaways.png" width="190px" height="110px" title="get aways" alt="get aways" /></a>
        

        <p>Of course, there are <i>companies out there that have great</i> web writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy <u>(that we slaved over)</u> into an ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>

        <h3>Website content template components</h3>

        <p><strong>Pre-writing questions:</strong> Before starting any given page, you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted. <br /> <br /> What’s their pain? <br /> What’s in it for them? Where are they in their buying process? <br /> And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your solution? <br /> <br /> The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.</p>
