        2. String: a - z; A - Z; 0 - 9; all symbols; ' ... ' / " ... " / ` ... `
        3. Boolean: true, false - 0 / 1

    2. Non - Primitive Data Types
        1. Arrays
        2. Functions
        3. Objects

    3. Misc., 
        1. Null 
        2. Undefined

-> Comment:
    1. Single Line: // ..... 
    2. Multi Line: /*
